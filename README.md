# Stock_Sentiment

Overview: 

I have always been interested in getting involved with stocks and wanted to learn different ways to help me make better investment decisions. I use this analysis to help me determine the sentiment of stock data using different resources and NLP along with deep learning. I can predict and understand what people are saying about certain stocks which will be helpful to me when I start to invest.
